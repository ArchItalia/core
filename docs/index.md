## About Core Linux

**Core Linux** is a minimal Linux distribution, based on Arch Linux, that focuses on simplicity and speed. It provides only essential packages for the proper functioning of the OS and is designed for customisation based on the user's needs. Core Linux is only available on 64-bit architectures and is also an official Linux distribution of the Architalia community.

To install Core Linux with its minimal and organised environment, navigate to the **installcore** application in the menu or type `installcore` in the console to start the installation process. You can also import your own guides or scripts to be run through the live based on Arch Linux.

The customised configuration of Core Linux comes with pre-installed packages such as **yay**, **timeshift**, and **AI-repo**, a repository that has other useful packages. The graphical environment comes with a minimalised version of **Gnome**, that has basic extensions that allow for convenient use. System updates can be managed easily with **Arch Linux updates indicator**, which is configured to handle official packages and AUR through the Core Linux **updates** script. **AppIndicator** allows for the system tray function to appear on the top bar, whereas **Night Theme Switcher** enables automatic switching between light and dark modes. **Desktop-icons-ng** is also available for desktop icons management. Other functions and packages are regularly added to the evolving distribution. 

The filesystem used is **btrfs**, with the creation of subvolumes **@** and **@home**, and **zram generator** is installed for swap management.

To ensure the upkeep of the system, use the **clean** tool that is installed and available by typing `clean` in the console.
